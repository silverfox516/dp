Strategy design pattern demo

Discussion. The Strategy pattern suggests: encapsulating an algorithm in a class hierarchy, having clients of that algorithm hold a pointer to the base class of that hierarchy, and delegating all requests for the algorithm to that "anonymous" contained object.

In this example, the Strategy base class knows how to collect a paragraph of input and implement the skeleton of the "format" algorithm. It defers some details of each individual algorithm to the "justify" member which is supplied by each concrete derived class of Strategy. The TestBed class models an application class that would like to leverage the services of a run-time-specified derived "Strategy" object.
